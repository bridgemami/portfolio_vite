      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      Ready to embark on an exciting journey in the world of web development? Look no further! With a bachelor&apos;s degree in business from Sonoma State University and over a decade of experience in the retail, hospitality, and customer service industries, I have honed my skills in delivering exceptional experiences to people. During my involvement in launching the tablet program at Black Stallion Estate Winery, I discovered my fascination with the transformative power of technology in streamlining business operations and enhancing efficiency.

      During the pandemic, a former manager suggested I take an HTML and CSS class to broaden my technology skills. That is when my journey into web development began, and I was instantly captivated. Exploring the intricacies of website structure, design, and interactivity became my new passion. Motivated to deepen my knowledge, I pursued an Associate in Science degree in Web Full-Stack Development from Santa Rosa Junior College, graduating with honors in December 2022.

      Beyond the realm of web development, I am an avid explorer of the world around me. Having traveled through over 25 countries in Europe and South America, I immerse myself in diverse cultures. Closer to home, I have ventured through more than 25 states, appreciating the rich tapestry of the United States. When I am not immersed in coding, you will likely find me hiking amidst the breathtaking beauty of the North Bay, seeking inner harmony through yoga, lacing up my running shoes for a revitalizing jog, or cherishing precious moments with my loved ones. In addition, I have a deep interest in learning about cultures, astronomy, and history, with a sprinkle of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings fandom.

      I am truly excited to share my web development projects and experiences with you through this portfolio. Let us embark on a captivating journey together, exploring the limitless possibilities at the intersection of creativity, technology, and human connection.
