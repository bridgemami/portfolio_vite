      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am Michael Bridgeman, a web developer born
        and raised in the vibrant Bay Area. With a bachelor&apos;s degree in business
        from Sonoma State University, I have spent over a decade honing my
        skills in the retail, hospitality, and customer service industries,
        always driven by my passion for delivering exceptional experiences to
        people. It was during my involvement in launching the tablet program at
        Black Stallion Estate Winery that I discovered my fascination with the
        transformative power of technology in streamlining business operations
        and enhancing efficiency.

        During the pandemic, a former manager suggested I take an HTML and CSS
        class to broaden my technology skills. That is when my journey into web
        development began, and I was instantly captivated. Exploring the
        intricacies of website structure, design, and interactivity became my
        new passion. Motivated to deepen my knowledge, I pursued an Associate in
        Science degree in Web Full-Stack Development from Santa Rosa Junior
        College, graduating with honors in December 2022.

        Beyond the realm of web development, I am an avid explorer of the world
        around me. I have traversed over 25 countries in Europe and South
        America, immersing myself in diverse cultures. Closer to home, I have
        ventured through more than 25 states, appreciating the rich tapestry of
        the United States. When I am not immersed in coding, you will likely
        find me hiking amidst the breathtaking beauty of the North Bay, seeking
        inner harmony through yoga, lacing up my running shoes for a
        revitalizing jog, or cherishing precious moments with my loved ones. In
        addition, I have a deep interest in learning about cultures, astronomy,
        and history, with a sprinkle of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings fandom.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am truly excited to share my web development projects and experiences
        with you through this portfolio. Let us embark on a captivating journey
        together, exploring the limitless possibilities at the intersection of
        creativity, technology, and human connection.
