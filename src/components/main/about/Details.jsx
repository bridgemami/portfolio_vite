        <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I earned an associate degree in full-stack web development in December
        2022 from Santa Rosa Junior College. In addition, I have been taking
        classes at BitWise Industries. When I am not coding, I enjoy hiking,
        running, yoga, traveling, and <em>Star Wars</em>.
